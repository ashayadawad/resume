> Subject: Application for the position of Software Trainee


Dear Sir/Madam,

I am submitting my application for the entry-level software engineer position at your organisation.
I am pursuing Masters in Computer Application from [CMR Institute of Technology, Bangalore](https://www.cmrit.ac.in/) and I am expected to graduate in 2022.
I have extensive knowledge in Java, Data structures, Oops concepts, HTML, CSS & Javascript. During my last one year at CMR Institute of Technology, I have been involved in various academic projects, technical seminars and extra-curricular activities. My ability to explain complex things into understandable terms would make me an ideal addition to your team.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my application. I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,

Asha Yadawad
